1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Flutter SDK: Make sure you have the Flutter SDK installed. See [Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
    *   Firebase Account: For cloud sync features, you'll need a Firebase project.
    *   OpenRouter API Key: For AI routine generation, an API key for OpenRouter (or a compatible service) is required.

2.  **Setup:**
    *   Clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone <repository-url>
        cd FitFarm 
        ```
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        flutter pub get
        ```
    *   **Firebase Setup:**
        *   Follow the FlutterFire CLI instructions to add your Firebase project configuration files (e.g., `google-services.json` for Android, `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS). See [FlutterFire Overview](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview).
    *   **API Key for AI Features:**
        *   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
        *   Add your OpenRouter API key to the `.env` file:
            ```env
            OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
            ```
        *   Ensure `flutter_dotenv` is correctly configured in `pubspec.yaml` and loaded in `main.dart`.

3.  **Run the App:**
